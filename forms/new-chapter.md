# PyLadies Request to Start Chapter Form

Please fill in the following form if you would like to lead a PyLadies chapter in your area.

You can also fill in this form if there is an inactive chapter in your area, and you would
like to step up and take it over.

Keep in mind that PyLadies is managed by volunteers and the approval or feedback on the
application might take a while. We try our best to review this once per month, however this is not guaranteed.

We recommend that you first join us in Slack and ask questions about starting a new
chapter in https://slackin.pyladies.com/ #prospective-organizers channel!

## Organizer

- `your name`
- `what are your pronouns (e.g. she/her, they/them)?`
- `your contact email`
- `username on PyLadies slack (Register first at https://slackin.pyladies.com/.)`
- `Who are your co-organizer(s) please include their name and pronouns? We advise having at least 2 organizers a chapter to start.`
- `What are your co-organizer(s) emails?`
- `What are your co-organizer(s) PyLadies Slack user names?`

## Background

- `How did you hear about PyLadies?`
- `Have you attended PyLadies meetups in other cities? If yes where?`
- `How do you and your organizer(s) use Python? Organizer(s) of all background levels are welcome! Understanding your relationship to Python is helpful for PyLadies to support your chapter as you get started.`

## Chapter Information

- `Desired namespace for chapter, this will be for the email and subdomain setup like [sf@pyladies.com] and it should be as close to the chapter name as possible. Remember, in Python, explicit is better than implicit!`
- `Is this a new chapter, or an existing (inactive) one?` (options)
  - new chapter
  - existing/inactive chapter
- `City of new chapter. PyLadies recommends a city specific focus to prevent name collision. If you want to start a chapter with a different affiliation please specify the location and why you are choosing this.`
- `Country of new chapter`
- `What language(s) will the chapter primarily speak?`

## Programming

- `What type of event(s) do you plan to run?`
- `How many events are you planning to do per year?`
- `When do plan to have your first event?`
- `What are your plans for the rest of the year?`
- `Do you have any specific support requests? For example, does your community speak a language other than English and will you want translation support?`
- `Have you received mentorship from existing chapter organizers? If not, please join us in Slack under #prospective-organizers channel`

## Agreement

- `I agree to await for official approval from PyLadies before starting to build resources online.`
- `I confirm that I read and understood our data privacy policy: PyLadies is committed to ensuring the security and protection of the personal information that we process, and to provide a compliant and consistent approach to data protection. We require the above information for PyLadies chapter management, internal record keeping and other related functions for managing the PyLadies brand that requires organizers input.`
