# PyLadies Project: Admin + Logistics

The proposal for this project can be found [here](https://github.com/pyladies/global-organizing/issues/38).

### Mission:

Creating new chapter and password reset require PyLadies Admin account in GSuite. However, other activities like reviewing chapter requests and other email communication do not require an admin account. As such, Project lead(s) should be one of the PyLadies Admin account, however team members can be any self-identifying PyLadies member.
