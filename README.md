# PyLadies Project: Admin + Logistics

The proposal for this project can be found [here](https://github.com/pyladies/global-organizing/issues/38).

### Mission

Creating new chapter and password reset require PyLadies Admin account in GSuite. However, other activities like reviewing chapter requests and other email communication do not require an admin account. As such, Project lead(s) should be one of the PyLadies Admin account, however team members can be any self-identifying PyLadies member.

### Responsibilities

1. Come up with a guideline of how to approve/reject chapters
do we have requirement about chapter proximities with another chapter? (i.e. if there is already a Vancouver chapter, do we allow a Burnaby chapter?)
2. Review "password reset" form and assist with password reset
3. Come up with guideline regarding inactive chapters
