# TL;DR:

The policy should answer the following questions

1. Why is the policy necessary
2. What is the purpose of a PyLadies chapter? What does it mean to start a PyLadies chapter? 
3. What are minimum responsibilities and expectation when someone requested a PyLadies chapter?
4. What kind of support can new chapter leaders expect from Global PyLadies leadership team?
5. What questions do we ask in our form?
6. How do we review new chapter requests?
7. For accountability, how do we document new chapter creations?

Timeline: I'd like to have this new process in place by end of January 2020.

# Details

## 1. Why is this policy necessary?

- We had many inactive chapters, that never took off since they were created

- We find chapters with more than one organizers to be more successful, and therefore it
  should be part of a minimum requirement.
  
- We don't have clear definition of what  or why one would want to start a chapter.
  Generally, there is expectation for ongoing and regular community event, instead of
  a one time workshop.
 
- Each PyLadies chapter uses resources in many forms: they might have Pro meetup
  account from The PSF, they may have website hosted, they might require funding from The PSF.

- PyLadies admins received numerous inquiries from community members regarding local
  chapters that turned out to be inactive, taking up additional resource/volunteer time
  from Global leadership and administrator team to address these inquiries. 
 
 - By better vetting new chapters, we hope to reduce unnecessary administrative work
   down the road, and better focus our efforts in helping active chapters.

## 2. What does it mean to start a PyLadies chapter?

We should define the purpose of local PyLadies chapter, and why a chapter would be necessary.

- help build and grow local Python community, through meetups, or sharing info through mailing lists, twitter, etc.

What are the roles of a PyLadies chapter leader?

- share news from global PyLadies leadership to their members

- organize at least one meetup per year (?)

- not necessarily be the one creating content/giving talk/workshop. 

- provide report once a year to global PyLadies leadership 

- notify global PyLadies leadership of changes in organizers (e.g. if they have new organizers, or if an organizer stepped down)

### 3. What are minimum responsibilities and expectation when someone requested a PyLadies chapter? 

- at least 2 co-organizers

- preferably run by women

- must be local (city-based). e..g Vancouver instead of BC or Canada

- namespace must be descriptive (`kuala-lumpur` instead of `kl`)?

### 4. What kind of support can new chapter leaders expect from Global PyLadies leadership team?

- as a chapter they can use PyLadies logo and name

- they will have @pyladies.com email address

- they can have pyladies subdomain

- access to organizers channel in slack

- access to organizers resources

Other privileges:

- a chapter gets one vote in PyLadies board elections

- ???

## 5. What questions do we ask in our form?

- name, email address, gender pronouns of at least 2 organizers

- desired namespace

- their Python/community background

- intent/ability to keep the community active. e.g. if they have thought of plan idea for a meetup within the next 1 year?

- their slack.pyladies.com username

- the chapter's primary spoken language(s)

- GDPR 

Note: Form questions are being worked in [Issue #12](https://github.com/pyladies/project-admin-logisitics/pull/12)

## 6. How do we review new chapter requests?

Prospective organizers will submit new chapter requests via a Google Form.

PyLadies admin & logistics team members will review new chapter requests once
per month. The schedule is TBD.

## 7. For accountability, how do we document new chapter creations?

PyLadies admin and logistics will keep track of the following info.

1. who requested the new chapter

2. who reviewed/approved the new chapter request

3. did we have additional questions to organizers?

4. date we activate the chapter
