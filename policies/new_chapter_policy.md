# TL;DR:

The policy should answer the following questions

1. Why is the policy necessary
2. What is the purpose of a PyLadies chapter? What does it mean to start a PyLadies chapter? 
3. What are minimum responsibilities and expectation when someone requested a PyLadies chapter?
4. What kind of support can new chapter leaders expect from Global PyLadies leadership team?
5. What questions do we ask in our form?
6. How do we review new chapter requests?
7. For accountability, how do we document new chapter creations?

Timeline: I'd like to have this new process in place by end of January 2020.

# Details

## 1. Why is this policy necessary?

- We had many inactive chapters, that never took off since they were created.

- We find chapters with more than one organizers to be more successful, and therefore it
  should be part of a minimum requirement.
  
- We don't have clear definition of what  or why one would want to start a chapter.
  Generally, there is expectation for ongoing and regular community event, instead of
  a one time workshop.
 
- Each PyLadies chapter uses resources in many forms: they might have Pro meetup
  account from The PSF, they may have website hosted, they might require funding from The PSF.

- PyLadies admins received numerous inquiries from community members regarding local
  chapters that turned out to be inactive, taking up additional resource/volunteer time
  from Global leadership and administrator team to address these inquiries. 
 
 - By better vetting new chapters, we hope to reduce unnecessary administrative work
   down the road, and better focus our efforts in helping active chapters.

## 2. What does it mean to start a PyLadies chapter?

We should define the purpose of local PyLadies chapter, and why a chapter would be necessary.

- help build and grow local Python community, through meetups, or sharing info through mailing lists, twitter, etc.

What are the roles of a PyLadies chapter leader?

- share news from global PyLadies leadership to their members

- organizes or supports co-organization of at least one meetup per year

- not necessarily be the one creating content/giving talk/workshop. 

- provide report once a year to global PyLadies leadership 

- notify global PyLadies leadership of changes in organizers (e.g. if they have new organizers, or if an organizer stepped down)

- use the chapter's @pyladies.com email address to conduct their business. (e.g. for
  any communication with their members, for creating meetup and social media accounts.)
  
### 3. What are minimum responsibilities and expectation when someone requested a PyLadies chapter? 

- Prior to requesting a chapter, prospective organizers are advised to join 
  [PyLadies Slack](https://slackin.pyladies.com), and post any questions related
  running a chapter in the `#prospective-organizers` channel. 

- A chapter should have at least 2 co-organizers at any time to help prevent
  organizer burnout, and to ensure the community can continue when one needs
  to take a break or to step down.

- A chapter is preferably run by women.

- A chapter must be local (city-based). e..g Vancouver instead of BC or Canada.
  A city's chapter is allowed when deemed appropriate, and will be approved
  on case-by-case basis.
  
- The chapter's namespace must be descriptive, e.g. `kuala-lumpur` instead of `kl`

### 4. What kind of support can new chapter leaders expect from Global PyLadies leadership team?

- As an official PyLadies chapter, they can use PyLadies logo and name, conforming
  to [PyLadies Trademark Policy](https://github.com/pyladies/pyladies-assets#pyladies-assets)

- They will be given @pyladies.com email address

- They can have pyladies subdomain

- Their chapter will be listed under PyLadies locations page

- Access to the #organizers channel in Slack

- Access to #organizers-resources channel in Slack

- Their chapter can join the PSF's Meetup Pro network

- Members of their chapter can participate and vote in PyLadies Board of Directors Elections


## 5. What questions do we ask in our form?

- name, email address, gender pronouns of at least 2 organizers

- desired namespace

- their Python/community background

- intent/ability to keep the community active. e.g. if they have thought of plan idea for a meetup within the next 1 year?

- their slack.pyladies.com username

- the chapter's primary spoken language(s)

- GDPR 

Note: Form questions are being worked in [Issue #12](https://github.com/pyladies/project-admin-logisitics/pull/12)

## 6. How do we review new chapter requests?

Prospective organizers will submit new chapter requests via a Google Form.

PyLadies admin & logistics team members will review new chapter requests once
per month. For this purpose, the team members involved in review process are those listed
in [project-admin-logistics team](https://github.com/pyladies/project-admin-logisitics#team).

### Review schedule

From the 1st to the 10th of each month, team members will review chapter request
from the previous month only. For example, from the 1st of 10th of April 2020,
we will review new chapter requests dated from March 1st to 31st 2020.

Decisions for the previous month's chapter requests shall be formed by the 10th
of each month.

Approved chapters will be created and activated by 15th of each month. The project's
team lead will create the chapter's email address by this date. Chapter organizers will receive email
notification as soon as email address has been created.

### Review mechanics

1. When prospective organizers filled in the new chapter request form, their response is stored as a row in google spreadsheet

2. PyLadies Slack Bot will post the form response into #feed-new-chapter Slack channel

3. Each reviewers will read the requests and give vote by adding either :thumbsup: or :thumbsdown: reaction to the Slack post.

4. If there is a :thumbsup: reaction made by one of the review team members, PyLadies Slack bot records the member name, and the timestamp.

5. If there is a :thumbsdown: reaction made by one of the review team members, PyLadies Slack bot will prompt for a reason. Team members will follow up.

6. If :thumbsup: or :thumbsdown: reaction was not made by review team member, PyLadies Slack bot will not do anything.

7. After the 10th of the month and before the 15th of the month, team lead will manually check the spreadsheet to see which ones are approved and create the chapters.

8. (To be determined) Ideally we should also record the summary of new chapters approvals to GitHub each month.

PyLadies Slack bot requires a Zapier account.

## 7. For accountability, how do we document new chapter creations?

The team will keep track of the following info:

1. who requested the new chapter

2. who reviewed/approved the new chapter request

3. did we have additional questions to organizers?

4. date we activate the chapter


## 8. When will this new policy take place.

We propose for this policy to take place starting March 1, 2020. We will be creating
the necessary forms, so prospective organizers can begin to request new chapter
starting on March 1, 2020.

## 8. Questions and comments about this proposal

If any PyLadies member and organizers have questions or concerns about this proposal,
please raise them by [opening an issue here](https://github.com/pyladies/project-admin-logisitics/issues).
Questions and comments are accepted from now until February 25th, 2020 AoE.

Unless we receive strong objection to this proposal by February 25th, 2020 AoE,
we will consider this proposal to be accepted and will take effect starting
March 1st, 2020.

## 9. Future changes to this policy

After this policy has taken affect, PyLadies Board of Directors reserve the right
to accept changes to this policy.
